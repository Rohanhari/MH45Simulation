# MH45Simulation
Simulation of MH-045 airfoil on FLUENT and OpenFOAM
The '0' directory contains the boundary and initial conditions for variables. 
The 'constant' directory contains the details of turbulent properties, transport properties and geometry.
The 'system' directory contains the information about the timestep, courant number, solvers and schemes. 
The code constains the .msh and fluent file for conversion of the mesh file from FLUENT to OpenFOAM, using FluentMeshToFOAM
